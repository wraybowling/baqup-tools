    <h2>Visualize Your Backup</h2>

    <p>
      When you're done backing up, you can use the snapshot to start migrating
      to another bank without losing your place.

    <h2>Wait. Why Do I need This?</h2>

    In short, Qube Money is pausing operations temporarily and instructing
    customers to move all of their funds out. You have the option to move your
    money out and keep paying for "Qube+" as a budgeting tool only or pause
    while your "settings will be saved," but both exit strategies present a
    problem: Moving money out tampers with your budget/goal progress tracking.
    If you are lucky enough to have not yet transferred your money out, this
    tool can create a snapshot that you can use as a reference to build out your
    goals and bills somewhere else. We don't know when Qube will come back, and
    they did not provide a backup tool, so I built one.

    <h2>Disclaimers</h2>

    <p>
      tldr; baQup Tools is an open source project independent of Qube Money. It
      was developed to be as clean and hands-off-your-data as possible, but it's
      also use-at-your-own-risk. I designed this tool for me, and wanted to
      share it with others. There are no ads, no trackers, and nothing that
      transfers your data to anyone else. My proof is in the code itself. Just
      in case, here's some fine print though..
