    <h2>What Does It Do?</h2>
    <p>
      You should get multiple files in your Downloads folder. The first is your
      account and budget information data. The rest of the files are your
      transaction details in batches of 20.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>baqup-account (timestamp).json</li>
      <li>baqup-transactions-0 (timestamp).json</li>
      <li>baqup-transactions-20 (timestamp).json</li>
      <li>baqup-transactions-40 (timestamp).json</li>
      <li>...</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Visualize Your Backup</h2>

    <p>
      When you're done backing up, you can use the snapshot to start migrating
      to another bank without losing your place.
    </p>

    <p>
      The files use the JSON format and can be opened in any text editor. You
      should store them somewhere encrypted for safety.
    </p>

    <p>
      By themselves, you may have trouble sifting through the large files. A
      visualizer is in the works.

    <h2>Wait. Why Do I need This?</h2>

    In short, Qube Money is pausing operations temporarily and instructing
    customers to move all of their funds out. You have the option to move your
    money out and keep paying for "Qube+" as a budgeting tool only or pause
    while your "settings will be saved," but both exit strategies present a
    problem: Moving money out tampers with your budget/goal progress tracking.
    If you are lucky enough to have not yet transferred your money out, this
    tool can create a snapshot that you can use as a reference to build out your
    goals and bills somewhere else. We don't know when Qube will come back, and
    they did not provide a backup tool, so I built one.

      independent of Qube Money. It was developed to be as clean and
      hands-off-your-data as possible, but it's also use-at-your-own-risk. I
      designed this tool for me, and wanted to share it with others. There are
      no ads, no trackers, and nothing that transfers your data to anyone else.
      My proof is in the code itself. Just in case, here's some fine print
      though..
